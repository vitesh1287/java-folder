variable = (condition) ? Expression2 : Expression3;


if condition is true then it goes to expression 2
if condition is false then it goes to expression 3


integer number are whole number + negative number=-1-2-3-4-5=012345

call by value- when we pass value as an argument to a function then it is call by value e.g.void add(int,int);
(call by value is copy of varables is pass to the function original value not change)

call by reference-when we pass address as an argument to function then it is call by refernce. e.g. void add(int*,int*);
(call by reference  then original value pass to the function )
